# Kaggle-Project
This is a mini Kaggle platform made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, where users can upload datasets, view code, and collaborate with comments â€” designed using Figma with a clean UI. It offers free access with a paid option for private notebooks and sponsor challenges, plus creative elements like animations and pop-ups to make it more interactive.
